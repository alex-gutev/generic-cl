GENERIC-CL provides a generic function wrapper over various functions
in the Common Lisp standard, such as equality predicates and sequence
operations. The goal of this wrapper is to provide a standard
interface to common operations, such as testing for the equality of
two objects, which is extensible to user-defined types.


== Usage ==

The generic function interface is contained in the `GENERIC-CL`
package. This package should be used rather than `COMMON-LISP`, as it
shadows the symbols, in the `COMMON-LISP` package, which name a
function for which there is a generic function wrapper. `GENERIC-CL`
additionally reexports the remaining non-shadowed symbols in
`COMMON-LISP`.

TIP: The `GENERIC-CL-USER` package is also provided, which contains
all the symbols in the `CL-USER` package and `GENERIC-CL`. This
package is intended to be used only at the REPL.


== Generic Interfaces ==

The generic function interface is divided into the following
categories:


=== Equality ===

The equality interface provides functions for testing for equality of
objects.

<<EQUALP>> is the generic binary equality predicate function to
implement for user-defined types. <<equalp-nary>> and
<<not-equalp-nary>> are the n-ary equality predicates similar to the
functions with the same names in the `COMMON-LISP` package.


==== EQUALP ====

Generic Function: `EQUALP A B`

Returns true if object `A` is equal to object `B`.

Methods:

* `NUMBER NUMBER`
+
Returns true if `A` and `B` represent the same numeric value, by
`CL:=`.

* `CHARACTER CHARACTER`
+
Returns true if `A` and `B` represent the same character, by
`CL:CHAR=`.

* `CONS CONS`
+
Returns true if the `CAR` of `A` is equal (by `EQUALP`) to the
`CAR` of `B` and if the `CDR` of `A` is equal (by `EQUALP`) to
the `CDR` of `B`.

* `VECTOR VECTOR`
+
Returns true if `A` and `B` are vectors of the same length and
each element of `A` is equal (by `EQUALP`) to the corresponding
element of `B`.

* `ARRAY ARRAY`
+
Multi-dimensional arrays.
+
Returns true if `A` and `B` have the same dimensions and each
element of `A` is equal (by `EQUALP`) to the corresponding
element of `B`.

* `STRING STRING`
+
Returns true if both strings are equal, by `CL:STRING=`.

* `PATHNAME PATHNAME`
+
Returns true if both `PATHNAME` objects are functionally
equivalent, as per the `PATHNAME-EQUAL` function from the
`CL-FAD` library.

* `T T`
+
Default method.
+
Returns true if `A` and `B` are the same object, by `CL:EQ`.


[[equalp-nary, =]]
==== = ====

to `X`.


=== Comparison ===

The comparison interface provides functions for comparing objects in
terms of greater than, less than, greater than or equal to and less
than or equal to relations.

<<LESSP>>, <<LESS-EQUAL-P>>, <<GREATERP>>, <<GREATER-EQUAL-P>> are the
generic binary comparison functions to implement for user-defined
types. It is sufficient to just implement `LESSP` as the remaining
functions have default methods that are implemented in terms of
`LESSP`.

<<lessp-nary>>, <<less-equal-p-nary>>, <<greaterp-nary>>,
<<greater-equal-p-nary>> are the n-ary comparison functions similar to
the functions with the same names in the `COMMON-LISP` package.


==== LESSP ====

Generic Function: `LESSP A B`

Returns true if object `A` is less than object `B`.

TIP: It is sufficient to just implement this function, for
user-defined types, as the rest of the comparison functions have
default (`T T`) methods which are implemented in terms of `LESSP`.

Methods:

* `NUMBER NUMBER`
+
Returns true if the numeric value of `A` is less than the numeric
value of `B`, by `CL:<`.

* `CHARACTER CHARACTER`
+
Returns true if the character code of `A` is less than the
character code of `B`, by `CL:CHAR<`.

equal to `B`, by `CL:STRING<=`.

* `T T`
+
Returns true if either `A` is less than `B` (by <<LESSP>>) or `A`
is equal to `B` (by <<EQUALP>>).

`(CL:FLOOR N)`.


==== CEILING ====

Performs the division `N/D` if `D` is provided, otherwise equivalent
to `N/1`, and returns the result rounded towards positive infinity as
the first value, and the `N - result * D` as the second return value.

Methods:

* `NUMBER`
+
Returns `(CL:CEILING N D)` if `D` is provided otherwise returns
`(CL:CEILING N)`.


==== TRUNCATE ====

Generic Function: `TRUNCATE N D`

Performs the division `N/D` if `D` is provided, otherwise equivalent
to `N/1`, and returns the result rounded towards zero as the first
value, and the remainder `N - result * D` as the second return value.

Methods:

* `NUMBER`
+
Returns `(CL:TRUNCATE N D)` if `D` is provided otherwise returns
`(CL:TRUNCATE N)`.


==== ROUND ====

* `T`
+
Returns the second return value of `(FLOOR N D)`.


==== REM ====

Methods:

* `NUMBER`
+
Returns `(CL:REM N D)`.

* `T`
+
Returns the second return value of `(TRUNCATE N D)`.


=== Objects ===

The object interface provides miscellaneous functions for manipulating
objects.


==== COPY ====

Generic Function: `COPY OBJECT &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Returns a copy of `OBJECT`. If `OBJECT` is mutable, by some other
functions, then the returned object should be distinct (not `EQ`) from
`OBJECT`, otherwise the return value may be identical (`EQ`) to
`OBJECT`.

IMPORTANT: This function may accept additional keyword arguments which
specify certain options as to how the object should be copied. Methods
specialized on sequences accept a `:DEEP` keyword parameter, which if
provided and is true a deep copy is returned otherwise a shallow copy
is returned. If a user-defined type acts as a container or sequence
then the `COPY` method for that type should also accept the `DEEP`
keyword parameter.

Methods:

* `CONS`
+
Returns a new list which contains all the elements in
`OBJECT`. If `:DEEP` is provided and is true, the list returned
contains a copy of the elements, copied using `(COPY ELEM :DEEP
     T)`.

* `VECTOR`
+
Returns a new vector which contains all the elements in
`OBJECT`. If `:DEEP` is provided and is true, the vector returned
contains a copy of the elements, copied using `(COPY ELEM :DEEP
     T)`.

* `ARRAY`
+
Multi-Dimensional Arrays.
+
Returns a new array, of the same dimensions as `OBJECT`, which
contains all the elements in `OBJECT`. If `:DEEP` is provided and
is true, the array returned contains a copy of the elements,
copied using `(COPY ELEM :DEEP T)`.

* `T`
+
Simply returns `OBJECT`.
+
This method is provided to allow sequences containing arbitrary
objects to be copied safely, without signaling a condition, and
to avoid having to write simple pass-through methods for each
user-defined type.
+
However this means that if the object, for which there is no
specialized copy method, can be mutated, the constraints of the
`COPY` function are violated.


==== DEFSTRUCT ====

Macro: `DEFSTRUCT OPTIONS &REST SLOTS`

This is the same as `CL:DEFSTRUCT` however a <<COPY>> method for the
structure type is automatically generated, which simply calls the
structure's copier function. If the `(:COPIER NIL)` option is
provided, the `COPY` method is not generated.


==== COERCE ====

Generic Function: `COERCE OBJECT TYPE`

Coerces `OBJECT` to the type `TYPE`.

The default (`T T`) method simply calls `CL:COERCE`.


=== Iterator ===

The iterator interface is a generic interface for iterating over the
elements of sequences and containers.

Implemented for lists, vectors, multi-dimensional arrays and
<<HASH-MAP>>'s.

.Basic Usage
[source,lisp]
----
(loop
   with it = (iterator sequence) ; Create iterator for SEQUENCE
   until (endp it) ; Loop until the iterator's end position is reach
   do
     (pprint (at it)) ; Print element at iterator's position
     (advance it)) ; Advance iterator to next position
----


[[iterator-struct, ITERATOR]]
==== Base Iterator Type ====

Structure: `ITERATOR`

This structure serves as the base iterator type and is used by certain
methods of generic functions to specialize on iterators.

All iterators should inherit from (include) `ITERATOR`, in order for
methods which specialize on iterators to be invoked.

IMPORTANT: A <<COPY>> method should be implemented for user-defined
iterators.


==== Iterator Creation ====

<<iterator-func>> is the high-level function for creating iterators,
whereas <<MAKE-ITERATOR>> AND <<MAKE-REVERSE-ITERATOR>> are the
generic iterator creation functions to implement for user-defined
sequence types.


===== MAKE-ITERATOR =====

Generic Function: `MAKE-ITERATOR SEQUENCE START END`

Returns an iterator for the sub-sequence of `SEQUENCE`, identified by
the range `[START, END)`.

`START` is the index of the first element to iterate over. `0`
indicates the first element of the sequence.

`END` is the index of the element at which to terminate the iteration,
i.e.  1 + the index of the last element to be iterated over. `NIL`
indicates iterate till the end of the sequence.


===== MAKE-REVERSE-ITERATOR =====

Generic Function: `MAKE-REVERSE-ITERATOR SEQUENCE START END`

Returns an iterator for the sub-sequence of `SEQUENCE`, identified by
the range `[START, END)`, in which the elements are iterated over in
reverse order.

IMPORTANT: Even though the elements are iterated over in reverse order,
`START` and `END` are still relative to the start of the sequence, as
in `MAKE-ITERATOR`.

`START` is the index of the last element to visit.

`END` is the index of the element following the first element to be
iterated over.


[[iterator-func, ITERATOR]]
===== ITERATOR =====

Function: `ITERATOR SEQUENCE &KEY (START 0) END FROM-END`

Returns an iterator for the sub-sequence of `SEQUENCE` identified by
the range `[START, END)`.

`START` (defaults to `0` - the start of the sequence) and `END`
(defaults to `NIL` - the end of the sequence) are the start and end
indices of the sub-sequence to iterate over (see <<MAKE-ITERATOR>> and
<<MAKE-REVERSE-ITERATOR>> for more a detailed description).

If `FROM-END` is true a reverse iterator is created (by
<<MAKE-REVERSE-ITERATOR>>) otherwise a normal iterator is created (by
<<MAKE-ITERATOR>>).


==== Mandatory Functions ====

These functions have to be implemented for all user-defined iterators.


===== AT =====

Generic Function: `AT ITERATOR`

Returns the value of the element at the current position of the
iterator `ITERATOR`.

WARNING: The effects of calling this method, after the iterator has
reached the end of the subsequence are unspecified.


===== ENDP =====

Generic Function: `ENDP ITERATOR`

Returns true if the iterator is at the end of the subsequence, false
otherwise.

The end of the subsequence is defined as the position past the last
element of the subsequence, that is the position of the iterator after
advancing it (by <<ADVANCE>>) from the position of the last element.

If the subsequence is empty `ENDP` should immediately return true.

NOTE: The default `T` method calls `CL:ENDP` since this function
shadows the `CL:ENDP` function.


===== ADVANCE =====

Generic Function: `ADVANCE ITERATOR`

Advances the iterator to the next element in the subsequence. After
this method is called, subsequent calls to <<AT>> should return the
next element in the sequence or if the last element has already been
iterated over, <<ENDP>> should return true.


==== Optional Functions ====

Implementing the following functions for user-defined iterators is
optional either because a default method is provided, which is
implemented using the mandatory functions, or the function is only
used by a select few sequence operations.


===== START =====

Generic Function: `START ITERATOR`

Returns the element at the current position of the iterator, if the
iterator is not at the end of the sequence, otherwise returns `NIL`.

The default method first checks whether the end of the iterator has
been reached, using `ENDP`, and if not returns the current element
using `AT`.

The default method is equivalent to the following:

[source,lisp]
----
(unless (endp iterator)
  (at iterator))
----

[[setf-at, (SETF AT)]]
===== (SETF AT) =====

Generic Function: `(SETF AT) VALUE ITERATOR`

Sets the value of the element at the position, in the sequence,
specified by the iterator.

WARNING: The effects of calling this function when, the iterator is
past the end of the subsequence are unspecified.

IMPORTANT: Implementing this function is only mandatory if destructive
sequence operations will be used.


===== ADVANCE-N =====

Generic Function: `ADVANCE-N ITERATOR N`

Advances the iterator by `N` elements.

IMPORTANT: The position of the iterator, after calling this function,
should be equivalent to the positioned obtained by calling <<ADVANCE>>
`N` times.

The default method simply calls <<ADVANCE>>, on `ITERATOR`, `N` times.


==== Macros ====

Macros for iteratoring over a generic sequence. Analogous to
`CL:DOLIST`.


===== DOITERS =====

Macro: `DOITERS (&REST ITERS) &BODY BODY`

Iterates over one or more sequences with the sequence iterators bound
to variables.

Each element of `ITERS` is a list of the form `(IT-VAR
SEQUENCE . ARGS)`, where `IT-VAR` is the variable to which the
iterator is bound, `SEQUENCE` is the sequence which will be iterated
over and `ARGS` are the remaining arguments passed to the
<<iterator-func>> function.

The bindings to the `IT-VAR`'s are visible to the forms in `BODY`,
which are executed once for each element in the sequence. After each
iteration the sequence iterators are <<ADVANCE>>'d. The loop
terminates when the end of a sequence is reached.


===== DOITER =====

Macro: `DOITER (ITER &REST ARGS) &BODY BODY`

The is the same as <<DOITERS>> except only a single sequence is
iterated over.


===== DOSEQ =====

Macro: `DOSEQ (ELEMENT SEQUENCE &REST ARGS) &BODY BODY`

Iterates over the elements of `SEQUENCE`. `ARGS` are the remaining
arguments passed to the <<iterator-func>> function.

The forms in `BODY` are executed once for each element, with the value
of the element bound to `ELEMENT`. If `ELEMENT` is a list, the
sequence element is destructured, as if by `DESTRUCTURING-BIND`
according to the pattern specified by `ELEMENT`.


=== Collector ===

The collector interface is a generic interface for accumulating items
in a sequence/container.

Implemented for lists, vectors and <<HASH-MAP>>'s.

.Basic Usage
[source,lisp]
----
;; Create collector for the sequence, in this case an empty list
(let ((c (make-collector nil)))
  (accumulate c 1) ; Collect 1 into the sequence
  (accumulate c 2) ; Collect 2 into the sequence
  (extend c '(3 4 5)) ; Collect 3 4 5 into the sequence
  (collector-sequence c)) ; Get the resulting sequence => '(1 2 3 4 5)
----


==== MAKE-COLLECTOR ====

Generic Function: `MAKE-COLLECTOR SEQUENCE &KEY FRONT`

Returns a collector for accumulating items to the end of the sequence
`SEQUENCE`. If `:FRONT` is provided and is true, the items are
accumulated to the front of the sequence rather than end.

IMPORTANT: The collector may destructively modify `SEQUENCE` however
it is not mandatory and may accumulate items into a copy of `SEQUENCE`
instead.


==== ACCUMULATE ====

Generic Function: `ACCUMULATE COLLECTOR ITEM`

Accumulates `ITEM` into the sequence associated with the collector
`COLLECTOR`.


==== COLLECTOR-SEQUENCE ====

Generic Function: `COLLECTOR-SEQUENCE COLLECTOR`

Returns the underlying sequence associated with the collector
`COLLECTOR`. The sequence should contain all items accumulated up to
the call to this function.

WARNING: The effects of accumulating items into the sequence, by
<<ACCUMULATE>> or <<EXTEND>>, after this function is
called, are unspecified.

CAUTION: The sequence returned might not be the same object passed to
<<MAKE-COLLECTOR>>.


==== EXTEND ====

Generic Function: `EXTEND COLLECTOR SEQUENCE`

Accumulates all elements of the sequence `SEQUENCE` into the sequence
associated with the collector `COLLECTOR`.

If `SEQUENCE` is an iterator all elements up-to the end of the
iterator (till <<ENDP>> returns true) should be accumulated.

NOTE: Implementing this method is optional as default methods are
provided for iterators and sequences, which simply accumulate each
element one by one using <<ACCUMULATE>>.

Methods:

* `T ITERATOR`
+
Accumulates all elements returned by the iterator `SEQUENCE`
(till `(ENDP SEQUENCE)` returns true), into the sequence
associated with the collector. The elements are accumulated one
by one using <<ACCUMULATE>>.
+
NOTE: The iterator is copied thus the position of the iterator passed
as an argument is not modified.

* `T T`
+
Accumulates all elements of `SEQUENCE`, into the sequence
associated with the collector. The elements are accumulated one
by one using <<ACCUMULATE>>.
+
NOTE: The sequence iteration is done using the <<iterator>> interface.


=== Sequences ===

Generic sequence functions.


==== Creation ====

The following functions are for creating a sequence into which items
will be accumulated using the collector interface.


===== CLEARED =====

Generic Function: `CLEARED SEQUENCE &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Returns a new empty sequence, of the same type and with the same
properties as `SEQUENCE`, suitable for accumulating items into it
using the collector interface.

NOTE: Individual methods may accept keyword parameters which specify
certain options of the sequence which is to be created.

Methods:

* `LIST`
+
Returns `NIL`.

* `VECTOR`
+
Returns an adjustable vector of the same length as `SEQUENCE`,
with the fill-pointer set to `0`.
+
If the `:KEEP-ELEMENT-TYPE` argument is provided and is true, the
element type of the new vector is the same as the element type of
`SEQUENCE`.


===== MAKE-SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE =====

Generic Function: `MAKE-SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE TYPE ARGS`

Returns a new empty sequence of type `TYPE`. `ARGS` are the type
arguments, if any.

The default method creates a built-in sequence of the same type as
that returned by:

[source,lisp]
----
(make-sequence (cons type args) 0)
----


===== SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE =====

Function: `SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE TYPE`

Creates a new sequence of type `TYPE`, using
<<MAKE-SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE>>.

If `TYPE` is a list the `CAR` of the list is passed as the first
argument, to `MAKE-SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE`, and the `CDR` is passed as the
second argument. Otherwise, if `TYPE` is not a list, it is passed as
the first argument and `NIL` is passed as the second argument.


==== Sequence Elements ====

===== ELT =====

Generic Function: `ELT SEQUENCE INDEX`

Returns the element at position `INDEX` in the sequence `SEQUENCE`.

Methods:

* `SEQUENCE T` and `VECTOR T`
+
Returns `(CL:ELT SEQUENCE INDEX)`.

* `ARRAY T`
+
Multi-Dimensional Arrays.
+
Returns `(ROW-MAJOR-AREF SEQUENCE INDEX)`.

* `T T`
+
Creates an iterator for `SEQUENCE`, with start position `INDEX`,
and returns the first element returned by the iterator.


===== (SETF ELT) =====

Generic Function: `(SETF ELT) VALUE SEQUENCE INDEX`

Sets the value of the element at position `INDEX` in the sequence
`SEQUENCE`.

Methods:

* `T SEQUENCE T` and `T VECTOR T`
+
Returns `(SETF (CL:ELT SEQUENCE INDEX) VALUE)`.

* `T ARRAY T`
+
Multi-Dimensional Arrays.
+
Returns `(SETF (ROW-MAJOR-AREF SEQUENCE INDEX) VALUE)`

* `T T T`
+
Creates an iterator for `SEQUENCE`, with start position `INDEX`,
and sets the value of the element at the starting position of the
iterator.


===== FIRST =====

Generic Function: `FIRST SEQUENCE`

Returns the first element in the sequence `SEQUENCE`.

Implemented for lists, vectors and multi-dimensional arrays. For
multi-dimensional arrays, the first element is obtained by
`ROW-MAJOR-AREF`.

The default method is implemented using <<elt,GENERIC-CL:ELT>>, i.e. is
equivalent to:

[source,lisp]
----
(elt sequence index)
----


===== LAST =====

Generic Function: `LAST SEQUENCE &OPTIONAL (N 0)`

Returns the `N`'th element from the last element of the sequence
`SEQUENCE`. `N` defaults to `0` which indicates the last element. `1`
indicates the second to last element, `2` the third to last and so on.

Implemented for lists, vectors and multi-dimensional arrays. For
multi-dimensional arrays, the last element is obtained by:

[source,lisp]
----
(row-major-aref sequence (- (array-total-size array) 1 n))
----

The default method is implemented using <<elt,GENERIC-CL:ELT>>, i.e. is
equivalent to:

[source,lisp]
----
(elt sequence (- (length sequence) 1 n))
----

CAUTION: The behaviour of this function differs from `CL:LAST` when
called on lists, it returns the last element rather than the last
`CONS` cell. The <<LASTCDR>> function performs the same function as
`CL:LAST`.


===== LASTCDR =====

Function: `LASTCDR LIST &OPTIONAL (N 1)`

This function is equivalent to `CL:LAST` list function.

Returns the `CDR` of the `N`'th `CONS` cell from the end of the list.


===== ERASE =====

Generic Function: `ERASE SEQUENCE INDEX`

Removes the element at index `INDEX` from the sequence `SEQUENCE`.

Destructively modifies `SEQUENCE`.

Methods:

* `VECTOR T`
+
Shifts the elements following `INDEX` one element towards the
front of the vector and shrinks the vector by one element.
+
CAUTION: Signals a `TYPE-ERROR` if the vector is not adjustable.

NOTE: This method is not implemented for lists as removing the first
element of a list cannot be implemented (efficiently) as a side effect
alone.


==== Sequence Length ====

===== LENGTH =====

Generic Function: `LENGTH SEQUENCE`

Returns the number of elements in the sequence `SEQUENCE`. If
`SEQUENCE` is an iterator, returns the number of remaining elements to
be iterated over.

This function is implemented for all Common Lisp sequences, returning
the length of the sequence (by `CL:LENGTH`), multi-dimensional arrays,
returning the total number of elements in the array (by
`ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE`), and <<HASH-MAP>>'s / hash tables, returning the
total number of elements in the map/table.

The following default methods are implemented:

* `ITERATOR`
+
Returns the number of elements between the iterator's current
position (inclusive) and the end of the iterator's subsequence.
+
This is implemented by advancing the iterator (by <<ADVANCE>>) till
<<ENDP>> returns true, thus is a linear `O(n)` time operation.
+
More efficient specialized methods are provided for iterators to
sequences for which the size is known.

* `T`
+
Returns the length of the generic sequence by creating an iterator to
the sequence and calling the <<iterator-struct>> specialized
method. Thus this is a linear `O(n)`, in time, operation unless a more
efficient method, which is specialized on the sequence's iterator
type, is implemented.


===== EMPTYP =====

Generic Function: `EMPTYP SEQUENCE`

Returns true if the sequence `SEQUENCE` is empty.

Implemented for lists, vectors, multi-dimensional arrays (always
returns `NIL`) and <<HASH-MAP>>'s.

The default returns true if <<ENDP>> returns true for a newly created
iterator for `SEQUENCE`.


===== CLEAR =====

Generic Function: `CLEAR SEQUENCE`

Destructively removes all elements from the sequence `SEQUENCE`.

Implemented for vectors and <<HASH-MAP>>'s.


==== Subsequences ====


===== SUBSEQ =====

Generic Function: `SUBSEQ SEQUENCE START &OPTIONAL END`

Returns a new sequence that contains the elements of `SEQUENCE` at the
positions in the range `[START, END)`. If `SEQUENCE` is an iterator,
an iterator for the sub-sequence relative to the current position of
the iterator is returned.

`START` is the index of the first element of the subsequence, with `0`
indicating the start of the sequence. if `SEQUENCE` is an iterator,
`START` is the number of times the iterator should be <<ADVANCE>>'d to
reach the first element of the subsequence.

`END` is the index of the element following the last element of the
subsequence. `NIL` (the default) indicates the end of the sequence. If
`SEQUENCE` is an iterator, `END` is the number of times the iterator
should be <<ADVANCE>>'d till the end position is reached.

Methods:

* `SEQUENCE T`
+
Returns the subsequence using `CL:SUBSEQ`.

* `ITERATOR T`
+
Returns a subsequence iterator which wraps a copy of the original
iterator.

* `T T`
+
Returns the subsequence of the generic sequence. This requires that
the <<CLEARED>> method, the <<iterator>> interface and <<Collector>>
interface are implemented for the generic sequence type.


===== (SETF SUBSEQ) =====

Generic Function: `(SETF SUBSEQ) NEW-SEQUENCE SEQUENCE START &OPTIONAL END`

Replaces the elements of `SEQUENCE` at the positions in the range
`[START, END)`, with the elements of `NEW-SEQUENCE`. The shorter
length of `NEW-SEQUENCE` and the number of elements between `START`
and `END` determines how many elements of `SEQUENCE` are actually
modified.

See <<subseq,SUBSEQ>> for more details of how the `START` and `END` arguments are
interpreted.

Methods:

* `SEQEUNCE SEQUENCE T`
+
Sets the elements of the subsequence using `(SETF CL:SUBSEQ)`.

* `T T T`
+
Sets the elements of the generic sequence using the <<iterator>>
interface, which should be implemented for both the types of
`SEQUENCE` and `NEW-SEQUENCE`. This method requires that the
<<setf-at>> method is implemented for the iterator type of `SEQUENCE`.


==== Sequence Operations ====

Generic function wrappers, which are identical in behavior to their
counterparts in the `COMMON-LISP` package, are provided for the
following sequence operations:

* `FILL`
* `REPLACE`
* `REDUCE`
* `COUNT`
* `COUNT-IF`
* `COUNT-IF-NOT`
* `FIND`
* `FIND-IF`
* `FIND-IF-NOT`
* `POSITION`
* `POSITION-IF`
* `POSITION-IF-NOT`
* `SEARCH`
* `MISMATCH`
* `REVERSE`
* `NREVERSE`
* `SUBSTITUTE`
* `NSUBSTITUTE`
* `SUBSTITUTE-IF`
* `NSUBSTITUTE-IF`
* `SUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT`
* `NSUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT`
* `REMOVE`
* `DELETE`
* `REMOVE-IF`
* `DELETE-IF`
* `REMOVE-IF-NOT`
* `DELETE-IF-NOT`
* `REMOVE-DUPLICATES`
* `DELETE-DUPLICATES`

Two methods are implemented, for all functions, which are specialized
on the following types:

* `CL:SEQUENCE`
+
Simply calls the corresponding function in the `COMMON-LISP`
package.

* `T`
+
Implements the sequence operation for generic sequences using the
iterator interface.
+
The non-destructive functions only require that the
<<mandatory-functions, Mandatory Iterator Functions>>, the
<<Collector>> interface and <<CLEARED>> method are
implemented for the sequence's type.
+
The destructive versions may additionally require that the optional
<<setf-at>> method is implemented as well.

IMPORTANT: The default value of the `:TEST` keyword arguments is
<<equalp,GENERIC-CL:EQUALP>>. This should be the default value when
implementing methods for user-defined sequence types. The `:TEST-NOT`
keyword arguments have been removed.

The following functions are identical in behavior to their `CL`
counterparts, however are re-implemented using the iterator
interface. Unlike the functions in the previous list, these are not
generic functions since they take an arbitrary number of sequences as
arguments.

* `EVERY`
* `SOME`
* `NOTEVERY`
* `NOTANY`

The following functions either have no `CL` counterparts or differ
slightly in behavior from their `CL` counterparts:


===== MERGE =====

Generic Function: `MERGE SEQUENCE1 SEQUENCE2 PREDICATE &KEY`

Returns a new sequence, of the same type as `SEQUENCE1`, containing
the elements of `SEQUENCE1` and `SEQUENCE2`. The elements are ordered
according to the function `PREDICATE`.

IMPORTANT: Unlike `CL:MERGE` this function is non-destructive.


===== NMERGE =====

Generic Function: `MERGE SEQUENCE1 SEQUENCE2 PREDICATE &KEY`

Same as `MERGE` however is permitted to destructively modify either
`SEQUENCE1` or `SEQUENCE2`.


===== SORT =====

Generic Function: `SORT SEQUENCE &KEY TEST KEY`

Returns a new sequence of the same type as `SEQUENCE`, with the same
elements sorted according to the order determined by the function
`TEST`. `TEST` is <<lessp,GENERIC-CL:LESSP>> by default.

IMPORTANT: Unlike `CL:SORT` this function is non-destructive.

TIP: For the default method to be efficient, efficient <<ADVANCE-N,>>
<<SUBSEQ>> and <<LENGTH>> methods should be implemented for the
iterator type of `SEQUENCE`.


===== STABLE-SORT =====

Generic Function: `STABLE-SORT SEQUENCE &KEY TEST KEY`

Same as `SORT` however the sort operation is guaranteed to be
stable. `TEST` is <<lessp,GENERIC-CL:LESSP>> by default.

IMPORTANT: Unlike `CL:STABLE-SORT` this function is non-destructive.

TIP: For the default method to be efficient, efficient <<ADVANCE-N,>>
<<SUBSEQ>> and <<LENGTH>> methods should be implemented for the
iterator type of `SEQUENCE`.


===== NSORT =====

Generic Function: `NSORT SEQUENCE &KEY TEST KEY`

Same as `SORT` however is permitted to destructively modify
`SEQUENCE`.


===== STABLE-NSORT =====

Generic Function: `STABLE-NSORT SEQUENCE &KEY TEST KEY`

Same as `STABLE-SORT` however is permitted to destructively modify
`SEQUENCE`.


===== CONCATENATE =====

Function: `CONCATENATE SEQUENCE &REST SEQUENCES`

Returns a new sequence, of the same type as `SEQUENCE`, containing all
the elements of `SEQUENCE` and of each sequence in `SEQUENCES`, in the
order they are supplied.

IMPORTANT: Unlike `CL:CONCATENATE` does not take a result type
argument.


===== NCONCATENATE =====

Function: `NCONCATENATE RESULT &REST SEQUENCES`

Destructively concatenates each sequence in `SEQUENCES` to the
sequence `RESULT`.


===== MAP =====

Function: `MAP FUNCTION SEQUENCE &REST SEQUENCES`

Creates a new sequence, of the same type as `SEQUENCE` (by
<<CLEARED>>), containing the result of applying `FUNCTION` to each
element of SEQUENCE and each element of each `SEQUENCE` in
`SEQUENCES`.

IMPORTANT: This function is equivalent (in behavior) to the `CL:MAP`
function except the resulting sequence is always of the same type as
the first sequence passed as an argument, rather than being determined
by a type argument.


===== NMAP =====

Function: `NMAP RESULT FUNCTION &REST SEQUENCES`

Destructively replaces each element of `RESULT` with the result of
applying `FUNCTION` to each element of `RESULT` and each element of
each sequence in SEQUENCES.

IMPORTANT: This function is similar in behavior to `CL:MAP-INTO` with
the exception that if `RESULT` is a vector, then `FUNCTION` is only
applied on the elements up-to the fill pointer i.e. the fill-pointer
is not ignored.


===== MAP-INTO =====

Function: `MAP-INTO RESULT FUNCTION &REST SEQUENCES`

Applies `FUNCTION` on each element of each sequence in `SEQUENCES` and
accumulates the result in RESULT, using the <<Collector>> interface.


===== MAP-TO =====

Function: `MAP-TO TYPE FUNCTION &REST SEQUENCES`

Applies `FUNCTION` to each element of each sequence in `SEQUENCES` and
stores the result in a new sequence of type `TYPE` (created using
<<SEQUENCE-OF-TYPE>>).  Returns the sequence in which the results of
applying the function are stored.

IMPORTANT: This function is equivalent in arguments, and almost
equivalent in behavior, to `CL:MAP`. The only difference is that if
`TYPE` is a subtype of vector, the vector returned is adjustable with
a fill-pointer. A `NIL` type argument is not interpreted as do not
accumulate the results, use <<FOREACH>> for that.


===== FOREACH =====

Function: `FOREACH &REST SEQUENCES`

Applies `FUNCTION` on each element of each sequence in `SEQUENCES`.

Returns `NIL`.


=== Generic Hash-Tables ===

This interface provides a hash-table data structure with the generic
function <<HASH>> as the hash function and the generic function
<<equalp,GENERIC-CL:EQUALP>> as the key comparison function. This
allows the hash-tables to utilize keys of user-defined types, whereas
the keys of standard hash tables are limited to numbers, characters,
lists and strings.

The generic hash-tables are implemented using
https://github.com/metawilm/cl-custom-hash-table[CL-CUSTOM-HASH-TABLE]. If
the Common Lisp implementation supports creating hash-tables with
user-defined hash and comparison functions, standard hash-tables are
used. However if the implementation does not support user-defined hash
and comparison functions, a fallback solution is used, which is a
custom hash-table implementation on top of standard hash-tables. The
<<HASH-MAP>> structure wraps the custom hash-table which allows
methods methods to be specialized on a single type `HASH-MAP`
regardless of whether standard or custom hash-tables are used. If the
`HASH-MAP` wrapper were not used, two identical methods would have to
be implemented, one specializing on standard hash-tables and one
specializing on custom hash-tables. More identical methods would have
to be implemented if the method has hash-table specializers for more
than one arguments, leading to a combinatorial explosion.

The functions in this interface are specialized on the `HASH-MAP`
type, due to the issue described above, thus use this type, created
with <<MAKE-HASH-MAP>>, rather than built-in hash-tables. If a
hash-table is obtained from an external source, use <<HASH-MAP>> or
<<ENSURE-HASH-MAP>> to convert it to a `HASH-MAP`.

*Standard Hash-Table Analogues:*

[width="80%",options="header"]
|====
| `CL:HASH-TABLE`| `HASH-MAP`

| GETHASH| GET
| HASH-TABLE-COUNT| LENGTH
| REMHASH| ERASE
| CLRHASH| CLEAR
|====



==== HASH-MAP ====

Structure: `HASH-MAP` with slots: `TABLE`

Function: `HASH-MAP TABLE`

The `HASH-MAP` structure wraps a standard `HASH-TABLE` or
`CUSTOM-HASH-TABLE`. The `TABLE` slot, accessed with `HASH-MAP-TABLE`,
stores the underlying hash-table.

The `HASH-MAP` function creates a hash-map wrapping a hash table
passed as its only argument.


===== Implemented Interfaces =====

The iterator interface is implemented for ``HASH-MAP``'s. Each element
returned by the iterator is a `CONS` with the key in the `CAR` and the
corresponding value in the `CDR`. The order in which the entries are
iterated over is unspecified. Likewise it is unspecified which entries
will be iterated over if `START` is non-zero and/or `END` is non-NIL,
the only guarantee being that `END - START` entries are iterated
over. The reverse iterator iterates over the entries in the same order
as the normal iterator due to the order of iteration being
unspecified.

The <<setf-at>> method for the `HASH-MAP` iterator sets the value
corresponding to the key of the current entry, being iterated over, to
the value passed as the argument to `SETF`.

The collector interface is implemented for ``HASH-MAP``'s. The
<<ACCUMULATE>> method expects a `CONS` where the `CAR` is the key of
the entry to create and the `CDR` is the corresponding value.

An <<EQUALP>> method is implemented for ``HASH-MAP``'s which returns
true if both maps contain the same number of entries and each key in
the first map is present in the second map, with the corresponding
value in the first map equal (by `EQUALP`) to the corresponding value
in the second
map.

WARNING: if the two maps have different test functions, the `EQUALP`
method is not necessarily symmetric i.e. `(EQUALP A B)` does not imply
`(EQUALP B A)`.

A <<COPY>> method is implemented for ``HASH-MAP``'s which by default
creates a new map with the same entries as the original map. If `:DEEP
T` is provided the values (but not the keys as they should be
immutable) are copied by `(COPY VALUE :DEEP T)`.


==== MAKE-HASH-MAP ====

Function: `MAKE-HASH-MAP &KEY TEST &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Creates a `HASH-MAP` wrapping a hash table with test function `TEST`,
which defaults to `#'GENERIC-CL:EQUALP`.

If `TEST` is either the symbol or function `GENERIC-CL:EQUALP`, then a
generic hash-table with hash function <<HASH>> and comparison function
<<equalp,GENERIC-CL:EQUALP>> is created. Otherwise `TEST` may be any
of the standard hash-table test specifiers.

The function accepts all additional arguments (including
implementation specific arguments) accepted by `CL:MAKE-HASH-TABLE`.


==== ENSURE-HASH-MAP ====

Function: `ENSURE-HASH-MAP THING`

If `MAP` is a <<HASH-MAP>> returns it, otherwise if `MAP` is a
`HASH-TABLE` or `CUSTOM-HASH-TABLE` returns a `HASH-MAP` which wraps
it. Signals an error if `MAP` is not of the aforementioned types.


==== HASH-MAP-TEST ====

Function: `HASH-MAP-TEST MAP`

Returns the test function, as a symbol, of the underlying hash table.

CAUTION: On some implementations the return value is not
`GENERIC-CL:EQUALP`, even if the hash table has `HASH` and
`GENERIC-CL:EQUALP` as its hash and comparison functions.


==== HASH ====

Generic Function: `HASH OBJECT`

Hash function for hash tables with the `GENERIC-CL:EQUALP` test
specifier.

Returns a hash code for `OBJECT`, which is a non-negative fixnum. If
two objects are equal (under <<GENERIC-CL:EQUALP>>) then the hash
codes, for the two objects, returned by `HASH` should be equal.

The default method calls `CL:SXHASH` which satisfies the constraint
that `(CL:EQUAL X Y)` implies `(= (CL:SXHASH X) (CL:SXHASH
Y))`.

IMPORTANT: Currently no specialized method is provided for
container/sequence objects such as lists. The default method does not
violate the constraint for lists (but does violate the constraints for
non-string vectors) as keys, provided they only contain numbers,
characters, symbols, strings and other lists as elements.


==== GET ====

Generic Function: `GET KEY MAP &OPTIONAL DEFAULT`

Returns the value of the entry corresponding to the key `KEY` in the
map `MAP`. If the `MAP` does not contain any entry with that key,
`DEFAULT` is returned. The second return value is true if an entry
with key `KEY` was found in the map, false otherwise.

Methods are provided for ``HASH-MAP``'s, standard ``HASH-TABLE``'s,
association lists (`ALISTS`) and property lists (`PLISTS`). For
`ALISTS` the <<EQUALP>> key comparison function is used. For `PLISTS`
the `EQ` key comparison function is used.


==== (SETF GET) ====

Generic Function: `(SETF GET) VALUE KEY MAP &OPTIONAL DEFAULT`

Sets the value of the entry corresponding to the key `KEY` in the map
`MAP`. `DEFAULT` is ignored.

IMPORTANT: Only a method for `HASH-MAPS` and `HASH-TABLES` is
provided.


==== ENSURE-GET ====

Macro: `ENSURE-GET KEY MAP &OPTIONAL DEFAULT`

Like `GET` however if `KEY` is not found in `MAP` it is added, by
`(SETF GET)` with the value `DEFAULT`.

The first return value is the value corresponding to the key `KEY`, or
`DEFAULT` if `KEY` is not found in `MAP`. The second return value is
true if `KEY` was found in `MAP`, false otherwise.


==== ERASE Method ====

Method: `ERASE (MAP HASH-MAP) KEY`

Removes the entry with key `KEY` from `MAP`.

Returns true if the map contained an entry with key `KEY`.


==== HASH-MAP-ALIST ====

Function: `HASH-MAP-ALIST MAP`

Returns an association list (`ALIST`) containing all the entries in
the map `MAP`.


==== ALIST-HASH-MAP ====

Function: `ALIST-HASH-MAP ALIST &REST ARGS`

Returns a <<HASH-MAP>> containing all entries in the association list
`ALIST`. `ARGS` are the additional arguments passed to
<<MAKE-HASH-MAP>>.


==== MAP-KEYS ====

Generic Function: `MAP-KEYS MAP`

Returns a sequence containing all the keys in the map `MAP`.

NOTE: Specialized only on ``HASH-MAP``'s and ``CL:HASH-TABLE``'s.


==== MAP-VALUES ====

Generic Function: `MAP-VALUES MAP`

Returns a sequence containing all the values in the map `MAP`.

NOTE: Specialized only on ``HASH-MAP``'s and ``CL:HASH-TABLE``'s.


==== COERCE Methods ====

The following `COERCE` methods are provided for `HASH-MAPS`:

* `HASH-MAP (EQL 'ALIST)`
+
Returns an association list (`ALIST`) containing all the entries in
the map. Equivalent to <<HASH-MAP-ALIST>>.

* `HASH-MAP (EQL 'PLIST)`
+
Returns a property list (`PLIST`) containing all the entries in
the map.


=== Set Operations ===

The set interface provides generic functions for performing set
operations and implementations of those operations for a hash-set data
structure.

Generic function wrappers are provided over the following Common Lisp
set operation functions:

* `SUBSETP`
* `ADJOIN`
* `INTERSECTION`
* `NINTERSECTION`
* `SET-DIFFERENCE`
* `NSET-DIFFERENCE`
* `SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR`
* `NSET-EXCLUSIVE-OR`
* `UNION`
* `NUNION`

For each function, methods specializing on `LISTS`, which simply call
the corresponding function in the `CL` package, and <<HASH-MAP>>'s are
implemented. Each function accepts all keyword arguments accepted by
the corresponding `CL` functions however they are ignored by the
`HASH-MAP` methods.

NOTE: <<HASH-MAP>>'s may be used as sets, in which case the set
elements are stored in the keys. The values of the map's entries are
ignored by the set operations, thus the map values of the sets
returned, by the set operation functions, are unspecified.


==== ADJOIN ====

Generic Function: `ADJOIN ITEM SET &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Returns a new set, of the same type as `SET`, which contains `ITEM`
and all elements in `SET`.

IMPORTANT: This function is non-destructive. A new set is always returned even if
`SET` is a <<HASH-MAP>> / <<HASH-SET>>.

NOTE: Accepts all keyword arguments accepted by `CL:ADJOIN` however
they are ignored by the <<HASH-MAP>> method.


==== NADJOIN ====

Generic Function: `ADJOIN ITEM SET &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Same as <<adjoin,ADJOIN>> however is permitted to destructively modify `SET`.

IMPORTANT: The set returned is `EQ` to `SET` in the case of `SET`
being a <<HASH-MAP>> however is note required to be `EQ` and is not
`EQ` if `SET` is a list. Thus this function should not be relied upon
for its side effects.

NOTE: Implemented for both lists and  <<hash-map,HASH-MAP>>'s.


==== MEMBERP ====

Generic Function: `MEMBERP ITEM SET &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Returns true if `ITEM` is an element of the set `SET`.

NOTE: Implemented for both lists and <<HASH-MAP>>'s. All keyword arguments
accepted by `CL:MEMBER` are accepted, however are ignored by the
`HASH-MAP` method.


==== HASH-SET ====

Structure: `HASH-SET`

A hash-set is a <<HASH-MAP>> however it is used to indicate that only
the keys are important. This allows the <<EQUALP>> and <<COPY>>
methods, specialized on `HASH-SET`'s to be implemented more
efficiently, than the methods specialized on ``HASH-MAP``'s, as the
map values are not compared/copied.

The implementation of the <<iterator,Iterator>> interface for `HASH-SETS` differs
from the implementation for `HASH-MAPS` in that only the set elements,
i.e. the keys of the underlying hash table, are returned rather than
the key-value pairs.

NOTE: The set operations are implemented both for ``HASH-MAP``'s and
``HASH-SET``'s.


==== HASH-TABLE-SET ====

Function: `HASH-TABLE-SET TABLE`

Returns a `HASH-SET` structure wrapping the standard `HASH-TABLE` or
`CUSTOM-HASH-TABLE`.


==== HASH-SET ====

Function: `HASH-SET &REST ELEMENTS`

Returns a <<HASH-SET>> with elements `ELEMENTS`.


==== MAKE-HASH-SET ====

Function: `MAKE-HASH-SET &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS`

Returns a new empty <<HASH-SET>>.

Accepts the same keyword arguments as <<MAKE-HASH-MAP>>. The default
`TEST` function is <<equalp,GENERIC-CL:EQUALP>>.


==== COERCE Methods ====

The following `COERCE` Methods are provided:

* `LIST (EQL 'HASH-SET)`
+
Returns a `HASH-SET` containing the elements in the list.


=== Math Functions ===

Generic function wrappers are provided over a number of math
functions. Methods specialized on `NUMBER` are provided, which simply
call the corresponding functions in the `CL` package. The idea of this
interface is to allow the mathematical functions to be extended to
vectors and matrices. This interface might not used as often as the
previous interfaces, thus is contained in a separate package
`GENERIC-MATH-CL` which exports all symbols exported by `GENERIC-CL`
and shadows the math functions.

Generic function wrappers are provided for the following functions:

* `SIN`
* `COS`
* `TAN`
* `ASIN`
* `ACOS`
* `ATAN`
* `SINH`
* `COSH`
* `TANH`
* `ASINH`
* `ACOSH`
* `ATANH`
* `EXP`
* `EXPT`
* `LOG`
* `SQRT`
* `ISQRT`
* `REALPART`
* `IMAGPART`
* `CIS`
* `CONJUGATE`
* `PHASE`
* `NUMERATOR`
* `DENOMINATOR`
* `RATIONAL`
* `RATIONALIZE`


=== Miscellaneous ===

==== DEFCONSTANT ====

Macro: `DEFCONSTANT SYMBOL VALUE &OPTIONAL DOCUMENTATION`

Ensures that `SYMBOL` is a constant with a value that is equal, by
`GENERIC-CL:EQUALP` to `VALUE`. This means that if `SYMBOL` already
names a constant, which occurs when the `DEFCONSTANT` form is
reevaluated, no condition will be signalled if its value is equal (by
`GENERIC-CL:EQUALP`) to `VALUE`.

NOTE: Implemented using `ALEXANDRIA:DEFINE-CONSTANT`


== Optimization ==

There is an overhead associated with generic functions. Code making
use of the generic function interface will be slower than code which
calls the `CL` functions directly, due to the cost of dynamic method
dispatch. For most cases this will not result in a noticeable decrease
in performance, however for those cases where it does there is an
optimization.

This library is built on top of
https://github.com/alex-gutev/static-dispatch[STATIC-DISPATCH], which
is a library that allows generic-function dispatch to be performed
statically, at compile-time, rather than dynamically, at runtime. The
library allows a call to a generic function to be replaced with the
body of the appropriate method, which is selected based on the type
declarations of its arguments.

For a generic function call to be inlined, the generic function has to
be declared inline (either locally or globally), and the arguments
must either have type declarations (if they are variables), or be
surrounded in a `THE` form.

  (declare (inline equalp)
	   (type number x))

  (equalp x (the number (+ 3 4))))

This will result in the call to the `EQUALP` function being replaced
with the body of the `NUMBER NUMBER` method.

The n-argument equality, comparison and arithmetic functions also have
associated compiler-macros which replace the calls to the n-argument
functions with multiple inline calls to the binary functions, e.g. `(=
1 2 3)` is replaced with `(and (equalp 1 2) (equalp 1 3))`.

Thus the following should also result in the `EQUALP` function calls
being statically dispatched, though this has not yet been tested:

[source,lisp]
----
(let ((x 1))
  (declare (inline equalp)
	   (type number x))

  (= x (the number (+ 3 4))))

IMPORTANT: STATIC-DISPATCH requires the ability to extract `TYPE` and
 `INLINE` declarations from implementation specific environment
 objects. This is provided by the
 https://github.com/alex-gutev/cl-environments[CL-ENVIRONMENTS]
 library however in order for it to work on all supported
 implementations, the `ENABLE-HOOK` function (exported by
 `GENERIC-CL`) has to be called at some point before the generic
 function call is compiled.

See https://github.com/alex-gutev/static-dispatch[STATIC-DISPATCH] and
https://github.com/alex-gutev/cl-environments[CL-ENVIRONMENTS] for
more information about these optimizations and the current
limitations.
